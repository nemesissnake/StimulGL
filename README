This text explains the contents of this StimulGL git repository and how it can be used.

--------
StimulGL 
--------
is an free/open source cross platform Stimulus presentation program that can be build/used/distributed under the terms of 
the GNU General Public License (GPL version 3), see see http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl.html.

Before you can use StimulGL you first need to build it with your favourite IDE, inside this repository you can find 
all the needed Project/Solution files to do this for:
- Qt Creator (*.pro, *.pri) (Windows/Linux/Mac)
- Microsoft Visual Studio 2008 (service Pack 1) (*.sln) (Windows)

The repository contains the following directories:

/Source directory:
Here you can find all the needed source code together with the Project/Solution files. Inside the /Source directory 
you find a /Plugin and /StimulGL folder. The /Plugin folder contains all the Plugin projects that can be used by 
StimulGL main program. The source code for the StimulGL program can be found in the /StimulGL folder. 
The /Source directory only contains the minimal number of files that are needed for the build (even after a build!). 
All other files (like files generated by the build or needed binaries/libraries etc) should not be committed to this folder.

/Install directory:
This directory contains all the needed files and binaries that you need for a valid installation. Some of them first need to 
be build by your IDE and some of them are already available in the /Install directory. A post build can copy the build output
from the IDE to this folder.

/InstallJammer directory:
This directory is the root directory for the InstallJammer project files and generated files. InstallJammer is used for
building the various installers for the StimulGL application (Windows and Linux). 

--------------
Build Options:
--------------
StimulGL can be build for various platforms (Windows/Linux/Mac) with 32bit or 64bit support (in debug and release mode). You
must also choose which Qt library (version and 32|64 bit) is used for the build of the main StimulGL program and plugins. 
Plugins build with one or more different Build Options as the StimulGL main program build do NOT work and are incompatible!
